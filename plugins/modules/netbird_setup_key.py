module: netbird_setup_key
short_description: Manage NetBird setup keys
description:
  - Create, update, and delete setup keys in NetBird.
  - Setup keys are used to register new peers to the network.
version_added: "1.0.0"
author:
  - NetBird (@netbirdio)
options:
  state:
    description:
      - The desired state of the setup key.
    type: str
    choices: ['present', 'absent']
    default: present
  key_id:
    description:
      - The unique identifier of the setup key.
      - Required when state is absent or when updating by ID.
    type: str
  name:
    description:
      - Name of the setup key.
      - Required when creating a new setup key.
      - Fixed at creation. The API's update accepts only O(revoked) and
        O(auto_groups), so a key found by O(key_id) with a different name
        is not renamed - the module warns about the drift instead.
    type: str
  key_type:
    description:
      - Type of the setup key.
      - "C(one-off) keys can only be used once."
      - "C(reusable) keys can be used multiple times."
    type: str
    choices: ['one-off', 'reusable']
    default: one-off
  expires_in:
    description:
      - Expiration time in seconds.
      - Default is 86400 (24 hours).

  revoked:
    description:
      - Whether the key is revoked.
    type: bool
    default: false
  auto_groups:
    description:
      - List of group IDs to auto-assign to peers registered with this key.
      - When updating an existing key and this is not specified, the current auto_groups are preserved.
    type: list
    elements: str
  usage_limit:
    description:
      - Maximum number of times the key can be used.
      - 0 means unlimited (for reusable keys).
    type: int
    default: 0
  ephemeral:
    description:
      - Whether peers registered with this key are ephemeral.
      - Ephemeral peers are automatically removed when disconnected.
    type: bool
    default: false
  allow_extra_dns_labels:
    description:
      - Allow extra DNS labels for peers registered with this key.
    type: bool
    default: false
  rotate_when_invalid:
    description:
      - What to do when a key is matched by O(name) but cannot enrol a peer
        because it is revoked, expired, or out of uses.
      - When V(false), the key is left untouched and a warning is emitted.
        The task still reports C(changed=false), because nothing was done.
      - When V(true), a replacement is created from the supplied parameters
        and the unusable key is deleted afterwards, so a failed create leaves
        the old key in place. The replacement's secret is returned once, in
        the same way as any newly created key.
      - Requires O(name), since that is what the replacement is created with.
        A key addressed by O(key_id) alone is left untouched and warns
        instead.
      - Has no effect when the matched key is usable, nor when O(revoked=true)
        is the desired state, where a revoked key is what was asked for rather
        than a problem to fix.

    operator enrolment is provisioned when the next peer to use it will
    fail, with nothing connecting the two events.

    ``desired_revoked`` is the task's own ``revoked`` parameter. A task asking
    for a revoked key has an unusable key as its desired state, so nothing
    here is a defect: without this, ``revoked: true`` would report a problem
    on every run, and with rotation enabled would delete and recreate the key
    every run, since the replacement is revoked too.

    ``valid`` is computed server-side and already covers expiry and
