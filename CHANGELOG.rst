v1.4.1
======

Release Summary
---------------

Patch release. Fixes netbird_an_provider silently skipping API key
rotation: providing api_key on an existing provider now forces the
update, since the sealed key can never be compared.

Bugfixes
--------

- netbird_an_provider - providing ``api_key`` on an existing provider now forces the update so the key is actually rotated. The API seals the key and never returns it, so it is excluded from change detection; previously a task passing only a new ``api_key`` reported ``ok`` and sent nothing, silently skipping the rotation. Omit ``api_key`` after creation to keep runs idempotent.

v1.4.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Feature release adding two new resource areas. Agent-network (AI gateway)
support arrives with dedicated modules for settings, providers, and
guardrails, including first-time bootstrap of non-provisioned accounts and
full export/preview/apply integration. Reverse-proxy services gain service
domains and proxy-cluster management. Also fixes a shallow-merge bug that
could drop account extra settings on partial updates, and stops injecting
empty sources/destinations into resource-targeted policy rules.

Major Changes
-------------

- Full agent-network (AI gateway) management. Five new modules (``netbird_an_settings``, ``netbird_an_provider``, ``netbird_an_policy``, ``netbird_an_guardrail``, ``netbird_an_budget_rule``), nine new ``netbird_info`` resource types, 22 new API helpers, name-to-ID resolution for providers/guardrails/groups in AN policies and budget rules, drift detection in the diff filter, and end-to-end integration in the configure role (preview, apply, strict-mode sweep) and export role (clean + raw output). Covers the full ``/api/agent-network/*`` surface.
- Full reverse-proxy service domain and proxy cluster management. Two new modules (``netbird_service_domain``, ``netbird_proxy_cluster``), two new ``netbird_info`` resource types (``service_domains``, ``proxy_clusters``), six new API helpers, service ``access_groups`` name resolution, service drift detection in the diff filter, and end-to-end integration in the configure role (preview, apply, strict-mode sweep) and export role (clean + raw output with group-ID-to-name resolution). Includes integration tests covering domain lifecycle, proxy cluster noop delete, and service auth variants (bearer, password, PIN). Completes the ``/api/reverse-proxies/*`` surface started in 1.3.0.

Minor Changes
-------------

- config_skeleton/services.yml - added config-as-code skeleton for services and service domains.
- configure role - agent-network resources are loaded from ``agent_network.yml`` (optional file) and applied in dependency order: guardrails and providers first, then policies and budget rules (which reference providers and groups by name).
- defaults/main.yml - added ``netbird_services``, ``netbird_service_domains``, and ``netbird_proxy_clusters_absent`` variables with documented examples.
- export role - agent-network resource exports are gated with ``ignore_errors`` so the role works on servers without the agent-network API.
- export role - service and service-domain API fetches are gated so the role does not 404 on management servers without the reverse-proxy API.
- export role - service auth metadata (bearer_auth enabled flags and distribution_groups) is preserved in the exported config.
- netbird_an_budget_rule - omitting one sub-limit (e.g. ``budget_limit``) when updating ``limits`` now preserves the existing sub-limit instead of clearing it. Same carry-forward applies to ``target_groups``, ``target_users``, and ``enabled``.
- netbird_an_provider - ``api_key`` is marked ``no_log`` and excluded from change detection (the API seals it and never returns it).
- netbird_an_provider, netbird_an_policy, netbird_an_budget_rule - ``enabled``, ``description``, and other optional fields have no argspec default. Omitting them on update carries the current value forward instead of silently resetting it. The API does a full replace on PUT, so every field must be present in the body; the modules handle this internally.
- netbird_info - added ``an_settings``, ``an_providers``, ``an_catalog_providers``, ``an_policies``, ``an_guardrails``, ``an_budget_rules``, ``an_access_logs``, ``an_access_log_sessions``, ``an_usage_overview``, and ``an_consumption`` resource types. ``an_access_logs`` and ``an_access_log_sessions`` are paginated (max 100 per page); the response envelope includes ``total_records`` and ``total_pages``.
- netbird_service_domain - a ``target_cluster`` change now emits ``module.warn()`` explaining the delete-and-recreate consequences (new ID, validation reset, bound services may break).

Security Fixes
--------------

- tasks/services.yml - the raw ``ansible.builtin.uri`` task for cluster deletion has been replaced by the new ``netbird_proxy_cluster`` module, which inherits ``no_log: true`` on ``api_token`` from the shared argument spec. The previous task interpolated ``Authorization: Token ...`` in headers, leaking the PAT under ``-vvvv``.
- tests/integration/test_services.yml - test services with known credentials (passwords, PINs) are no longer left running on the live tenant after the test completes.

Bugfixes
--------

- configure role - a policy rule targeting a resource (``source_resource``/``destination_resource``) no longer fails with ``422 specify either destinations or destination resources, not both`` (https://github.com/netbirdio/ansible-netbird/issues/67). The resolver stamped ``sources: []`` and ``destinations: []`` onto every rule, so a rule defined only with the resource form reached the API carrying both a resource reference and an empty group list, which the API rejects. Group references are now only resolved (and only present) when the rule actually defines them.
- defaults/main.yml - the ``mode: tcp`` example no longer includes ``path`` and ``protocol: http``, which are L7 options the API rejects for TCP services.
- export role - guarded the ``type`` attribute in ``selectattr`` filters for service domains so entries without a type field do not cause template errors.
- export role - password_auth and pin_auth blocks are no longer exported with empty secrets. An export-then-apply round-trip previously sent ``password: ""`` / ``pin: ""`` to the API, silently producing unauthenticated services. Only bearer_auth (no secrets) is now exported; a YAML comment flags the omission.
- netbird_account - a task setting only one ``extra_*`` option (e.g. ``extra_network_traffic_logs_enabled``) no longer silently resets every other ``extra`` setting (``extra_peer_approval_enabled``, ``extra_user_approval_required``, ``extra_network_traffic_packet_counter_enabled``, ``extra_network_traffic_logs_groups``) to its zero value. The account settings PUT is full-replace with no server-side nil-check on ``extra``'s subfields, and the module only merged the desired update against the current settings one level deep, so a request naming a single ``extra_*`` key replaced the whole nested object instead of merging into it. ``extra`` is now merged at the subkey level against the current settings, the same pattern already used for netbird_group's full-replace fields.
- netbird_service_domain - ``find_domain_by_name`` now filters to ``type == 'custom'``, skipping free/proxy entries that have an empty ``id``. Matching one of those issued ``DELETE /domains/`` with no ID path segment.
- netbird_service_domain - ``validate: true`` now triggers validation on existing unvalidated domains. Previously it only fired on the create path, where DNS was not yet configured, and was silently ignored on re-runs when the domain already existed.
- netbird_service_domain - a failed re-create on cluster change now rolls back to the original cluster instead of leaving the domain deleted. The create response is also validated before proceeding.
- tests/integration/test_services.yml - fixed ``lookup('env')`` defaults that never applied and converted string values to proper types. Conditional blocks now always run so later phases that depend on their resources are not skipped.

v1.3.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Correctness and safety release. Name lookups now refuse ambiguous
matches instead of guessing, network resources are identified by
name with in-place address updates, and setup keys warn about
states they cannot change (including one-way revocation) with
opt-in rotation for keys that can no longer enrol peers. Group
deletion can resolve ``auto_groups`` pins, routes expose
``access_control_groups``, reverse-proxy services support peer and
cluster targets with working TCP/UDP/TLS modes, and a DNS zone's
name defaults to its domain. Breaking: a network router's
``masquerade`` now defaults to ``true``, matching the dashboard,
and the collection requires ansible-core 2.15 / Python 3.9.

Minor Changes
-------------

- configure role - a ``netbird_dns_zones`` entry may now carry a ``domain`` with no ``name``, matching the module. Previously the unguarded ``item.name`` failed such an entry on an undefined variable before the module ran - in the zone task, and again in the strict-mode orphan sweep, which failed the whole pass.
- configure role and netbird_diff - the preview and strict paths now identify a zone entry the same way the module does. A domain-only entry was previously read as a zone named '', so the preview reported it as new and reported the real zone as orphaned - which a strict run would then have deleted.
- netbird_api (module_utils) - ``create_network_router`` now defaults ``masquerade`` to ``true`` as well, so the helper agrees with the module that calls it. ``netbird_network`` always passes the value explicitly, so this changes nothing on its own.
- netbird_api (module_utils) - ``unpin_group`` refuses the whole sweep, before writing anything, when the API reports no role for a user owner. The user PUT is full-replace and ``update_user`` drops a ``None`` role from the payload, so the API would read the role as empty and answer 422 "invalid user role" - a message saying nothing about the group being unpinned, arrived at after editing any earlier owners. It is the one field with no safe fallback.
- netbird_dns_zone - ``name`` now defaults to ``domain`` when omitted, and a zone can be declared from a domain alone. A zone's name and its domain are the same thing in every case that works, so the only correct combination is now also the one you get for free.
- netbird_dns_zone - a zone not found by name is now looked up by ``domain`` before being created. A zone whose name has drifted from its domain is exactly what the new default exists to heal, and it is invisible to a name lookup, so declaring it from its domain alone would have created a second zone for the same domain -- and ``state: absent`` would have reported success having deleted nothing.
- netbird_dns_zone - an ambiguous domain now fails the task instead of returning the first match. Duplicate domains are exactly what the missing fallback used to create, so they are the likely state of an affected tenant, and picking one would rename or delete an arbitrary member of the pair.
- netbird_dns_zone - warn when ``name`` is set to something other than ``domain``. The API permits it, but consumers that resolve zones by name, including the NetBird Kubernetes operator, cannot find such a zone.
- netbird_group - ``state=absent`` on a group referenced by a setup key's or a user's ``auto_groups`` now fails with a message naming every owner holding it, by email. The API's own 400 names only the first blocking reference it finds, in a fixed order, and identifies a user by raw ID, so a group held by three owners took three round trips to unpick. The new ``unpin_auto_groups=true`` option removes the group from those owners first and then deletes it, returning the owners it touched in ``unpinned``. It is opt-in because peers enrolled through those owners stop receiving the group. Either setting costs two extra list calls per ``state=absent``, since the owners must be found before the delete is attempted.
- netbird_group - a failure after unpinning now carries the ``unpinned`` list, holding what was actually edited before the error, and an owner's own update failing is re-raised naming that owner. Between them they describe the whole partial state: the list says what succeeded, the message says what broke. That covers both a delete still refused by a policy or route referencing the group, and a failure partway through the sweep; either way the operator would otherwise have to reconstruct what changed from the API.
- netbird_group - in check mode the warning now says what *would* be unpinned rather than reporting it in the past tense, since nothing is written.
- netbird_network - documented that renaming a resource is a replacement rather than an edit. The new name matches nothing that exists, so the resource is deleted and recreated with a new ID, and policy rules referencing the old one by ``destination_resource`` need reapplying. A named resource's address can be changed freely; an unnamed resource is identified by its address, so changing that is a replacement as well.
- netbird_network - documented what ``masquerade`` actually does on a router, and when disabling it is appropriate, rather than only naming the field.
- netbird_route - added the ``access_control_groups`` option, which gates which peers may reach the routed CIDR. It had no module surface, so any routed ACL required a raw API call alongside the module. Omitting the option preserves whatever the route already has; pass an empty list to clear it. A change to it is picked up by the change comparator, so it is applied rather than dropped.
- netbird_service - ``targets[].host`` is no longer required. It is optional in the API (``ServiceTarget.Host`` is ``*string, omitempty``), and a peer target is addressed by ``target_id`` with no backend address of its own, so requiring it made that target type impossible to express. The key is now omitted from the payload when unset rather than sent empty.
- netbird_service - added ``cluster`` to the ``targets[].target_type`` choices, completing the API's enum (subnet, host, domain, peer, cluster).
- netbird_service - added ``targets[].proxy_protocol``, which sends a PROXY Protocol v2 header so a TCP or TLS backend can see the original client address. It is compared by the change detector like the other target options.
- netbird_setup_key - a key matched by ``name`` that cannot enrol a peer, because it is revoked, expired or out of uses, now warns instead of reporting the desired state as met. Previously the task returned ``changed: false`` and the failure surfaced later, at enrolment, with nothing connecting the two events.
- netbird_setup_key - added ``rotate_when_invalid``, which replaces such a key rather than only warning about it. Off by default, and requires ``name``, since that is what the replacement is created with. The replacement is created before the invalid key is deleted, so a failed create leaves the old key in place. It has no effect when ``revoked: true`` is the desired state, where an unusable key is what was asked for.
- netbird_setup_key - warn when a task asks to change a parameter the API fixes at creation time (``name``, ``key_type``, ``usage_limit``, ``ephemeral``, ``allow_extra_dns_labels``) on a key that already exists. The API ignores the request, so the module no longer implies it applied.
- routes tasks and export role - ``access_control_groups`` is now passed through by ``tasks/routes.yml`` and emitted by the route export template. Without both, the option existed on the module but could not be reached from the config-as-code path, and exporting a route that carried an ACL produced a config file which did not record it.

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- The collection now requires ansible-core 2.15 or newer and Python 3.9 or newer (previously ansible-core 2.12 / Python 3.6). This aligns the declared support floor with the modules' existing Python 3.6+ syntax and is set consistently across ``galaxy.yml``, ``meta/runtime.yml``, ``meta/main.yml``, ``README.md`` and ``tests/config.yml``.
- netbird_network - the ``masquerade`` sub-option of ``routers`` now defaults to ``true`` instead of ``false``, matching the dashboard, which enables masquerading on every routing peer it creates, and matching ``netbird_route``, which already defaulted to ``true``. Read this as a change to existing routers, not only to new ones: the default is applied by the argspec, so a router declared without an explicit ``masquerade`` now compares unequal to one the old default created, and the very next run of the module updates it. Traffic then leaves with the router's own source address instead of the original client's. Any playbook relying on the old default must set ``masquerade: false`` explicitly before upgrading. This ships in 1.3.0 rather than waiting for a major release: the collection is young, the old default produced routers that silently did not route, and this entry is the warning.

Bugfixes
--------

- all modules that match an object by name - an ambiguous name now fails the task instead of silently returning the first match. The NetBird API does not enforce unique names, so a lookup can legitimately match more than one object, an IdP-synced group colliding with a hand-made one being the usual way it happens. Taking the first match meant reading, diffing and rewriting an object the task never identified, reported as an ordinary ``changed: true``. The failure names the count and says to disambiguate by id. Affects ``netbird_dns``, ``netbird_dns_zone``, ``netbird_group``, ``netbird_idp``, ``netbird_network``, ``netbird_policy``, ``netbird_posture_check``, ``netbird_setup_key``, ``netbird_token`` and ``netbird_user``.
- config_skeleton/networks.yml - corrected the guidance on a router's ``peer``. A comment claimed it must be a peer ID and that peers are not name-resolvable; both halves are false, since ``netbird_resolve`` resolves a router's ``peer`` by name and raises on an unknown one. The commented examples below it used ID-shaped placeholders and said to find them via export or the UI, so the file taught the same thing twice - and the config-as-code guide's networks example taught it a third time, fixed the same way. It is what new users copy from, and following it meant threading opaque IDs through every network definition.
- netbird_network - a resource whose ``address`` changed is now detected as needing an update. It was previously the identity, so a change to it could not be an update; the comparator did not look at it, and without that the edit would now be dropped.
- netbird_network - network resources are now matched by ``name``, falling back to ``address`` only for resources that have none. Keying on address had two silent consequences: two resources sharing an address, which the API allows and which is how one host is exposed under two names with different distribution groups, collapsed into one before any request was made; and editing an address became a delete-and-recreate, so the resource ID churned and anything holding it, such as a policy rule's ``destination_resource``, pointed at an object that no longer existed.
- netbird_network - two resources resolving to the same identity now fail the task, on both sides of the comparison. Dict construction resolves a collision by keeping the last one, and a shadowed resource on the server side also drops out of the delete sweep, so it survived every run unmanaged while the task reported success.
- netbird_service - ``targets[].path_rewrite`` is no longer sent for TCP, UDP and TLS services unless explicitly set. It defaulted to ``preserve`` and was sent unconditionally, but the API rejects any value on those modes ("path_rewrite is not supported for L4 services"), so every non-HTTP service this module built was refused. HTTP services still default to ``preserve``, so their behaviour is unchanged.
- netbird_service - a change to a ``cluster`` target's ``host`` is now detected. ``host`` is excluded from the target match key for non-subnet types because ``replaceHostByLookup`` overwrites it on every read path, but it skips cluster targets, whose upstream address rides on ``target_id`` - so a cluster host is stored and returned verbatim and is the operator's to manage. It is also the one type where host is both required and meaningful, and editing it was silently ignored. Peer, host and domain targets are deliberately still excluded: that rewrite is unconditional, so comparing their host would report drift against a value no playbook set and no PUT could settle.
- netbird_setup_key - a key addressed by ``key_id`` with a different ``name`` no longer reports ``changed: true`` on every run. The API's update accepts only ``revoked`` and ``auto_groups``, so the "update" never renamed anything; the mismatch is now reported with the other creation-fixed parameters instead.
- netbird_setup_key - a task naming a revoked key no longer fails. ``revoked`` defaults to ``false``, so the module asked to un-revoke it without the playbook ever mentioning the field, and the API refuses that ("can't un-revoke a revoked setup key") - the task died on a 422 about something it had not asked for. The current value is now carried forward, with a warning saying revocation cannot be undone. Revoking an unrevoked key, the permitted direction, is unchanged.

New Modules
-----------

- community.ansible_netbird.netbird_service - Manage NetBird reverse\-proxy services

v1.2.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Quality-focused release: tightens reference validation across the
configure role, prevents silent drops on partial-update fields,
and fixes several round-trip / export consistency issues.

Security Fixes
--------------

- roles (configure, export): add ``no_log: true`` to raw ``ansible.builtin.uri`` tasks that interpolate ``Authorization: Token ...`` headers, preventing bearer-token leak under ``-vvvv`` (PR #36).

Bugfixes
--------

- configure role: normalise a relative ``config_dir`` against the controller CWD so ``include_vars: dir:`` resolves correctly (PR #35).
- configure role: raise on unresolved group / peer / posture_check references instead of silently dropping them; add hostname aliases for peer lookup (PR #33).
- export role / netbird_dns: null-guard DNS nameserver ``domains`` and ``groups`` on export and update so the dashboard does not crash on legacy ``null`` state.
- export role: export peer-based policy sources via ``sourceResource`` fallback so peer-resource-bound policies survive round-trip (PR #31).
- netbird_dns: heal DNS nameserver group ``domains=null`` to ``[]`` at the module layer when applying config (PR #34).

v1.1.0
